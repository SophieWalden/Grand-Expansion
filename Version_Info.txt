 v1 Aquired Fork: Aquired Fork from  8BitToaster ->  https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Expansion.
                    will be updating this to handle custom ai, and be assisting in the devlopment.

                    Edit: Edit some changes, mostly visual to help aid in making changes/ readable, will be fixing
                    it over the course of this project lifespan.
                        -Updated ReadMe.md'


 v2 Tidying Up: Tidying up the code at the moment, before get to modifying it. I'm pretty stoked about this, my excitment
                    on seeing this mini program grow is gonna be a blast!!.

                    Besides that the main objectives is to clean up the code:
                     line 993-1074 @ Main.py requires work on readability
                      -line 300 @ Menu.py -> speed to gather resources
                        Once the program gets a bit more finalize will be increasing the time it takes to gather resource
                        this will also includes for a number of factors that will contribute to the speed as well.


v3 Tidy Up/Modify: Made a source folder to contain the fonts & source modules. Also modified the images -> Solar Power
                        & Super Factory to Solar_Power & Super_Factory. Modified the rest of the program to compensate
                        for this change.
                        Will be working on fixing the issue with upgrading the factory.
                        At the moment if the user upgrades it to either super factory or solar power the image will not
                        change to their choosing.
                        After that will be working on a new upgrade under the classifcaiton for 'Power'. This will be
                        used for Solar Power & any other power sources that can be used to obtain electricity.
                        While the factory will be obtaining metals


----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v4 Font Source Edit : Modified Font to import source_modules instead of having 2-3 files having the same info

                          -  # and pos[0] <= ### -> Mouse Selection Y Layer
                          -  # and pos[1] >= ### -> Mouse X Layer Disengage Cutoff
                          -  # and pos[1] <= ### -> Mouse Y Layer Disengage Cutoff

v18 Farm->Town->City Update: making the final changes for farm -> town -> city images before I get started on making the
                                city function to be the farm function first, which will create food.
                                The player will then have the option on upgrading the farm into a town
                                which will produce less food but increase the pop.
                                The user will have 5 more upgrades for the town which will increase the consumption
                                of electricty & food, after words the city upgrade will be availb. which will
                                consume the most food, but produces x,y,z resources (will update later).

                                If the player's food production goes neg the population will decrease and cause
                                damage to the town/city and in future updates possible riots/hostile forces from that
                                city to try to claim it -> A.I implemnt


                                v18.5 Images Folder Update: added new folder to hold specific images regarding their
                                                        category & usage

                                v18.8 TempImg Implement: Implemented TempImg, so the folders can be active/be used
                                                            as a reference for future updates to this game.
                                                            Will be updating up these components @ a later date.

                                                            Main objective is to make the city building start with
                                                            farm then town lastly to city. Each upgrade will have its
                                                            own pro's and cons. Any changes the user will have to
                                                            weigh the options on the cost & benefit to that move.

                        be working on the game itself.

v24 Re-Import: re-imported the orignal code onto Grand_Expansion as a reference/ onto folder Grand Expansion
                    as of now the orignal has minimal bugs and its currently without the bugs of the fishing boat atm.

                    Once the auto size is complete, will add it onto GE (Grand Expansion) as well.


--v25 Game Start: game is bootable atm, now will work on making the window screen more modifyable.
                    New files added @ GC_Source gc_game_data.py which gets gc_source_modules import *
                    and display the screen size of the game -> this will be worked on making it more modifyable.

                    New file @ GC_Source -> tile_information. Basically the tile info regarding the different buildings
                    , and soon to be units. As of now this connects to mainMenu.py @ line 19-52 has the % on # of
                    times a certain tile set is shown to the user on the Main Menu.

                    Will update again once gets the screen size to be more screen friendly.
