# Grand Expansion 

Grand expansion was a little resource management simulation game built during Winter 2018-2019. 

Expand your universe, and when you have too many resources reset for ever-present buffs and a bigger map to simulate new worlds on!
Resources: Wood, Stone, Food, Electricity, Metal, and many more!
