Will be modifying it to handle the A.i & improving the concept of this mini civ game. 
Most likely be implementing a couple of my custom projects to help speed up the process a bit.

Besides that feel free to check out the code, tweak it and have fun. As long your finding ways on 
improving your self and the community then your already ahead of the game ^_*
